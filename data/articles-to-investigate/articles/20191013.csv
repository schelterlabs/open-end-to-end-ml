What's unwelcome is his bigotry.,https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/img/pages/article/opengraph_default.jpg,"This editorial appears in The Washington Post: 
 - - - 
 In a season of bigotry, President Donald Trump has often reveled in the role of bigotry's loudest troubadour, spouting hateful rhetoric designed to sow and exploit racial, ethnic and nationalist discord. At a campaign rally in Minneapolis on Thursday, he returned to the theme, at the expense of Minnesota's community of Somalis, eliciting jeers and boos at their very mention from his audience. 
 Telegraphing what is certain to be among his favorite refrains in the 2020 campaign, Trump remarked on the ""impact"" of Minnesota's 50,000 Somalis, who began arriving there a quarter-century ago as refugees and now represent roughly 1% of the state's population. Referring to an executive order he issued recently, the president said he will prohibit refugee resettlements unless states and cities expressly consent to them. 
 ""Believe me,"" he said of his policy to grant communities what amounts to a veto on refugee resettlement, ""no other president would be doing that."" 
 The president has made no secret of his dislike generally for refugees, having slashed by 85% the annual cap on their admission, or specifically those from Somalia, which is among the mainly Muslim countries listed in his travel ban. Just before Election Day in 2016, he told Minnesotans they had ""suffered enough,"" suggesting that inadequate vetting was to blame for the influx of refugees there. 
 In truth, the fact that so many Somalis wound up in Minnesota - many resettled there by Lutheran and Catholic charities - owes much to the generally hospitable reception they received there, as had Hmong refugees from Southeast Asia who came to the state following the Vietnam War. 
 About 23,000 Somalis arrived in Minnesota directly as refugees; many others moved there based on..."

 Hundreds of Islamic State family members escaped a detention camp after Turkish shellfire hit the area, U.S. troops pulled out from another base and Turkish-backed forces consolidated their hold over a vital highway, cutting the main U.S. supply route into Syria. 
 By the time Defense Secretary Mark Esper appeared on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" to announce that President Donald Trump had ordered the final withdrawal of the 1,000 U.S. troops in northeastern Syria, it was already clear that the U.S. presence had become unsustainable, U.S. officials said. 
 The announcement by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that they had reached an agreement with the Iranian and Russian-backed government of President Bashar Assad further undermined the prospect of any continued U.S. presence in the country. The deal brings forces loyal to Assad back into towns and cities that have been under Kurdish control for seven years. 
 ""An agreement has been reached with the Syrian government - whose duty it is to protect the country's borders and preserve Syrian sovereignty - for the Syrian Army to enter and deploy along the Syrian-Turkish border to help the SDF stop this aggression"" by Turkey, the SDF said in a statement. 
 It was unclear where and when the Syrian troops would deploy or whether U.S. forces were already pulling out of areas where they are based. U.S. officials declined to confirm local media reports that troops had pulled out of the towns of Manbij and Kobane, where local officials confirmed they had agreed to allow Syrian troops to deploy.

Description:The Greenfield Lecture is funded through an endowment established by Drs. Rosalee and Raymond Weiss to honor her mother, Corinne Sternheimer Greenfield, who was born in Jonesboro in 1896 and whose family was among the first to support the state agricultural school that is now Arkansas State University. The story every student needs to hear! As teachers at a South African farm school, Zodwa Dlamini’s parents emphasized to her that education was the key to escaping the clutches of apartheid. Driven by a strong desire to improve the lives of those in her community, she committed herself to hard work and an education that she would later harness to effect positive change, reigniting hope for her South African community. Zodwa received a PhD in Social Foundations in 1992 from the University of Iowa where she researched the education of homeless children in South Africa. Zodwa returned to South Africa in 1994 to vote in the first non-racial democratic election. She later became head of the Northern Cape Province Education Department and Chief Delegate for the Lesotho Highlands Water Commission. Her exceptional hard work motivated by the desire to end the injustice and discrimination she experienced as a child is a story that will deeply touch and inspire many. This is the first event of a three-part subseries concerning Africa."
