LOUIS (AP) - A Missouri man was executed Tuesday for killing a man during a series of violent crimes in 1996, despite concerns that the inmate's rare medical condition would cause a gruesome lethal injection. 
 Russell Bucklew was executed at the state prison in Bonne Terre. It was Missouri's first execution since January 2017. 
 Bucklew had twice previously been within hours of execution, only to have the U.S. Supreme Court grant last-minute reprieves over concerns that he might suffer during the execution process. He had a condition called cavernous hemangioma and had blood-filled tumors in his head, neck and throat. He breathed with help from a tracheostomy tube. 
 Bucklew's attorneys said in a clemency request to Gov. Mike Parson that a throat tumor could burst, causing Bucklew to choke and die painfully and in violation of the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. 
 Bucklew looked around and twitched his feet beneath the sheet as he lay on the gurney just before the lethal injection. He suddenly took a deep breath and all movement stopped. There were no outward signs of distress. 
 Cheryl Pilate, one of Bucklew's attorney's, said several steps were taken to try to ensure that he didn't suffer, including sedating him prior to the execution and elevating the gurney to help prevent him from choking. 
 ""We believe the significant efforts that went into making this a less horrible process were beneficial,"" Pilate said. 
 Adding to the concern was Missouri's secretive execution drug. The state uses a single dose of pentobarbital but refuses to say where it gets it. The source is believed to be a compound pharmacy since large pharmaceutical companies prohibit the use of their drugs in executions. 
 The Supreme Court stepped in to halt..."

 It's a situation to which they are accustomed. 
 Whether it's Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey or other hot spots, American diplomats say ""contain the damage"" - a quote from the Ukraine whistle-blower's letter to Congress released last week - has become their job description after 2 1/2 years serving Trump. Their goal isn't to head off his policies, but to keep him from sabotaging the very plans he's put into motion. 
 ""I think the president has made it repeatedly and abundantly clear that he is the only one who makes U.S. foreign and security policy,"" said Heather Conley, director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""But by neutering his team, he undercuts his success as a commander-in-chief."" 
 Trump, who came to office skeptical of foreign policy professionals but was willing to consider their counsel, is sufficiently confident in his abilities to dispense with them altogether. Last week's release - by Trump - of a partial transcript of his July telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demonstrates how the American president is willing to ignore his formal foreign-policy team when he's convinced he can be more effective. 
 ""The way I would describe it is they see themselves serving as those bumpers you put up when you take your kid bowling so the person doesn't roll a gutter ball,"" said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. ""But in this instance, a gutter ball is war with Iran or a nuclear armed missile coming from North Korea.""

The prospect of his removal from office remains remote but can no longer be called far-fetched. As a nation, we must be prepared to withhold judgment until the fact-finding is complete. His admitted conduct is troubling, but any honest impeachment process will demand all the facts, and fully consider any exculpatory evidence. That obligation to respect the process extends as much to Trump as it does to voters, lawmakers or the press itself. So far, the president has failed to live up to that responsibility. His typically bombastic rhetoric has become alarming — and potentially dangerous. On Monday, he denounced Rep. Adam Schiff, the designated leader of the impeachment proceedings in the House, as a traitor. He ended his rant - one of many these past few days - with the quite literal suggestion that Schiff be arrested for treason. The day before, he wrote on Twitter that Schiff’s statements about the now-famous call with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy were presented in “perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber” — never mind that the basic outline of the alleged abuse of power was contained in the records of the call released by the White House last week. Right after Zelenskiy thanks Trump for U.S. defense support and asks for more, Trump responds with words destined to become as memorable as..."
