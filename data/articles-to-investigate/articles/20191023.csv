 The factory's 4,800 workers and two other big facilities -- another truck plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with 4,500 staff, and an Arlington, Texas, operation with more than 5,000 -- have yet to weigh in ahead of a Friday deadline. It may come down to ""yes"" votes at these busy GM factories edging out ""no"" votes from members at the carmaker's idled plants and others that build smaller vehicles that are less secure. 
 Those three big plants make out well under the deal -- it provides them iron-clad job security over the four-year contract and beyond. The automaker is rolling out new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups from Flint and Fort Wayne, where it's adding staff. In Arlington, GM has invested $1.4 billion since 2015 to build the next generation of Cadillac Escalade, Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon SUVs. 
 Workers at those three factories -- which account for 30% of the UAW's entire voting membership at GM -- may be content with promised concessions such as 3% raises in two years, 4% lump sums for the other two and $11,000 ratification bonuses. Those opposed are unswayed by pay bumps and angered that GM is closing three plants at a time of near-record profits. 
 ""It's more likely to pass than not,"" said Harley Shaiken, professor of labor relations at the University of California at Berkeley. ""You have workers in their fifth week on the picket line and want to get back. You have a big signing bonus, health-care benefits intact and a way to harmonize pay for workers."" 
 Still, Shaiken cautions that workers entered the negotiating period angry about GM threatening to close four..."

 The agreement, reached after an hours-long meeting between Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi, will leave Turkey and Russia in control of territory formerly held by Kurdish forces once allied with the United States. 
 More importantly, though, the deal bolstered Russia's preferred endgame in Syria's civil war by allowing its ally, Syrian President Bashar Assad, to regain control over more of his country's territory. Russia is also prodding states in the region to recognize, either explicitly or tacitly, the Syrian government's authority, analysts said. 
 The Turkey-Russia agreement came as the deadline expired on a separate deal Turkey made last week with the United States to ""pause"" its advance into Syria in preparation for a full cease fire. In exchange, the United States agreed initially to clear Syrian Kurdish fighters from a strip about 75 miles long and 20 miles deep along the border - and to lift existing sanctions on Turkey and refrain from imposing more. 
 Hours after the expiration, a senior Trump administration official said that Kurdish leaders had confirmed their withdrawal from that portion of the border, and that Turkey was believed to have stopped its southern advance. Although discussions were still underway in Washington, the official indicated that sanctions would not go forward. 
 ""Good news seems to be happening with respect to Turkey, Syria and the Middle East,"" President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday evening...."

But by the afternoon, Trump allies were pointing out that variations of that word had been invoked several times by House Democrats to describe the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton in 1998. 
 At least five House Democrats talked about a ""lynching"" or ""lynch mob"" as pertaining to Clinton, according to a Fix review. 
 ""The highest officeholder should think about these words. The rural south where I was born has a tarnished and painful history,"" Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill., tweeted Tuesday. 
 ""I don't expect Trump to be sensitive to the weight of that word, or see how insulting and hurtful it is to invoke it here,"" Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., tweeted Tuesday. 
 In 1998, however, both Davis and Meeks called the Clinton impeachment proceedings a ""lynching"" on the House floor the day before the president was impeached. Then-Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., described what he called a ""lynch mob mentality, that says this man has to go"" during a floor speech the same day. 
 Democratic criticisms of the Republican-led impeachment proceedings against Clinton were not limited to the House floor. 
 Then-Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., called the impeachment proceedings against Clinton a ""partisan lynching"" during an October 1998 appearance on CNN. On Tuesday, Biden called Trump's tweet ""abhorrent."" 
 ""Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable,"" Biden tweeted. 
 On three occasions in 1998, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who now chairs the committee that would consider articles of impeachment against Trump, called the impeachment..."
