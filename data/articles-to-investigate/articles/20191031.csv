 The 2015 graduate of Pearland High School is the stage manager and communications coordinator for  4th Wall Theater Company , a professional group in Houston. 
 ""My sophomore year in high school, I acted in 'Our Town' and it wasn't good,"" said Menzel, 22. 
 However, convinced that theater was her calling, Menzel joined the ""running crew"" of the PHS musical ""South Pacific,"" which won top musical and best crew and technical execution at the 2013 Tommy Tune Awards. 
 ""I instantly fell in love with it,"" she said. ""Telling a story is what really draws me in. Also, I enjoyed the sense of community, especially in high school theater."" 
 After graduating from Pearland, Menzel attended San Jacinto College South, where its theater and film department's professor and artistic director, Kevin Holden, arranged for Menzel to intern at 4th Wall. 
 ""I was exposed to many wonderful people who were so nice to me as a beginner,"" she said. 
 Happy with her work, the theater hired Menzel as its communications manager with duties including being stage manager for each show in the group's 2019-2020 season. 
 As communications manager, she interacts with reporters as well as theater patrons through email and social-media blasts. 
  Breakable 'Menagerie' pieces and other tricky challenges  
 As 4th Wall's stage manager, Menzel sometimes faces technical challenges not unlike the task the Pearland High stage crew faced of operating a running shower in ""South Pacific"" for Nellie Forbush to use while singing ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right..."
