The new rule - issued at 7 p.m. on a Friday night less than 13 months before Election Day - comes as President Donald Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry and intensifying his efforts to fulfill his campaign promises to curb immigration. Like many of Trump's immigration policies, it is likely to face swift legal challenges in federal courts. Trump said he is taking the action to ""protect the availability of health care benefits for Americans,"" and said ""taxpayers bear substantial cost"" in paying for medical expenses of people who lack health insurance. ""Immigrants who enter this country should not further saddle our health care system, and subsequently American taxpayers, with higher costs,"" Trump said in the proclamation. Analysts said the proclamation appears to target family-based migration, the type of so-called ""chain migration"" that the Trump administration and White House aide Stephen Miller, an immigration hawk, have been unable to persuade Congress to reduce. The White House has pushed for policies that would favor wealthier immigrants with special skills over immigrants from poorer countries, including in Latin America. Trump's proclamation comes as the administration is also preparing to implement a new ""public charge"" rule Oct. 15 that seeks to deny green cards and U.S. citizenship to poor immigrants. To obtain an immigration visa, foreigners must prove they will be covered by ""approved health insurance,"" such as a family or employment-based policy, within 30 days of..."

 The two sides met in Stockholm on Saturday to resume nuclear negotiations after eight months of stalemate over denuclearization and sanctions. 
 The top North Korean nuclear envoy Kim Myong Gil said the working-level talks had broken off ""entirely due to the United States' failure to abandon its outdated viewpoint and attitude."" 
 State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus disputed North Korea's comments as not reflecting ""the content or spirit of today's 8 1/2 hour discussion."" 
 She said Washington brought ""creative ideas"" and ""a number of new initiatives"" to the talks, while North Korea blamed the United States for coming ""empty-handed."" 
 Saturday's talks were the first since President Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam in February. Trump's personal diplomatic overtures to Kim, including an informal meeting at the demilitarized zone in June, were put to a test as Pyongyang resumed weapons tests. 
 North Korea tested a new submarine-launched ballistic missile on Wednesday, days before the nuclear talks with Washington were set to resume. 
 Envoy Kim said whether Pyongyang breaks its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and missile testing ""entirely depends on the stance of the United States."" 
 The State Department said Washington is willing to resume discussions with Pyongyang in two weeks, but the North Koreans have not expressed such an intention. 
 Van Jackson, a former Pentagon official and now a lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington, said Trump's personal diplomacy with North Korea has undermined the nuclear negotiations. ""From North Korea's perspective, there is nothing to be gained..."
