Henry Pokrywa, pastor of Faith Community Chapel on Rose Road. “I don’t feel that public streets should be used to display anyone’s sexuality, whatever that may be.” Gregory Hallock, executive director of Genesee-Orleans Regional Arts Council (GO ART!) and leader of the GO OUT! group that promotes LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning) causes, filed the application for the event, which will run from 6:30 to 10 p.m. The parade is set to begin at Austin Park and proceed on Washington, Ellicott and Richmond avenues before ending on Bank Street, near the GO ART! building. Following the parade, activities will take place on Bank Street near Alva Place. A DJ will provide music and there will be games. Alcoholic beverages will be available, but only on GO ART! premises, according to the application. Hallock thanked City Council for approving the festival and then listened as Pokrywa questioned its validity. “The gentleman (Hallock) said that this (local Pride movement) has grown,” Pokrywa said, noting that the parade will include floats. “I don’t know the standards, but I’m pretty sure there should be public decency and morality standards. There will be children there.” Pokrywa said he was “not against anybody” but when it comes to “public morality, we have to decide where we draw that line.” Lauren Berger, of Mount Morris, a training coordinator for RESTORE sexual assault services, followed Pokrywa to the podium, reporting statistics that indicate an increase in sexual violence and harassment against those who identify as LGBTQ+ and calling for Batavia to assist in getting the word out to help these people. “Batavia can be the answer to the LGBT desert,” she said. After that, four Council members spoke in favor of the parade and picnic. “I don’t want to deny any group,” Rose Mary Christian said. “Thousands of people (enlisted men and women) have died for us to have this freedom.” Council President Eugene Jankowski said “we know what (gay pride parades) look like, and we’re going to be better than that (and not discriminate),” adding that any violence would be addressed. “We’re not going to single out people,” Kathleen Briggs said. “We always give our approval.” And Patti Pacino advised that “you don’t have to be part of the LGBT community to be part of the parade.” “I will be in the parade, and I’m very straight.” The GO OUT! event was one of several items discussed by Council, preceding the board’s passage of seven resolutions on the meeting’s agenda. City Manager Martin Moore reported that, after meeting with Police Chief Shawn Heubusch and department heads, that he is forming a crime task force to tackle the recent spate of violence. “Our goal is that we don’t want these types of individuals (criminal element from outside the area) in our city and decisive actions will be taken,” Moore said. “The bottom line is that it is unacceptable for our citizens to not feel safe to walk out of their front doors.” Residents have been on edge in recent weeks as a result of several incidents, including the fatal stabbing of a man outside his home on Ross Street after he went to the aid of a woman who was in a physical altercation with a man. Moore said that the task force will get started within the next couple and is expected to include leadership from Genesee County, including the district attorney’s office. “There is going to be a lot of work. We don’t have a committee just to do committees,” he said, adding that he will keep City Council informed throughout the process. In a related development, Heubusch informed Council members that he is hoping to fill a void in his department by hiring three new police officers by early July. He said he has a substantial list of candidates who scored well on the Civil Service exam, with an eye of sending the top three – after an extensive interview and background check process – to the police academy in Erie County on Aug. 5. “Still, even if we hired three officers today, it would be about a year until we could put them on the street,” he said, noting that the academy runs for five months and is followed by four months of field training. Currently the department lists 33 officers, including the chief and assistant chief. Moore also reported that a request by Genesee/Orleans Council on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse to provide a social gathering place for recovering addicts at the former North Pole Restaurant at 241-243 S. Swan St. “does not fit within an R-2 (Residential) zone.” Moore said a letter stating as such was sent to GCASA Executive Director John Bennett, but he has not received a response. Several Council members (as well as residents in that area) went on record last month against GCASA’s proposal, and Council Member Rose Mary Christian reiterated her opposition tonight, applauding the Code Enforcement office’s conclusion. Council also heard from North Spruce Street resident Anita Tolejko, who urged the board to do something about motorists who drive the wrong way on the one-way street, primarily from Chase Park to East Main. She called for a “traffic study, big signs and flashing lights” to put an end to this illegal practice. “I really don’t know, but I would like something done” (before a head-on collision takes place),” she said. In other action, Council: -- Set a public hearing for 7 p.m. June 24 (the date of the next City Council meeting) on a resolution that would relax the residency requirements for new municipal employees per the Batavia Municipal Code. Jankowski said the amendments focus on expanding the geographical area around the city where new employees may live to include any adjacent town to Genesee County within six months of the date of conclusion of the probationary period for the City. The employee also would be required to live within these areas for the duration of his or her employment. -- Entered into a contract with a company called three+one, of Pittsford, for cash liquidity and treasury analyses that would lead to increased returns on investments and bank accounts for the City. The City’s cost to enter the program is $9,900, but that would be returned by three+one if the company fails to find at least $50,000 in additional savings. The Pittsford firm previously teamed up with the Town of Batavia and Genesee County, with the county reporting significant additional income. -- Approved agreements with the Batavia City School District that calls for the school to provide transportation of students to the new Teen City site at the former St. Anthony’s School on Liberty Street and to maintain the former City Youth Bureau at 12 MacArthur Drive. Teen City is partnering with City Church, which owns the Liberty Street property, and the Genesee Area YMCA to offer an after-school youth program. It is expected to begin operation during the week of Aug. 19. -- Authorized the appointment of City residents Nicholas Harris, Marc Staley and David Leone and Council members Robert Bialkowski and Paul Viele to the Audit Advisory Board."

Their experiences of healthcare at the end of life and how these compare with the general population are unknown.

Aim To describe the end-of-life care outcomes for adults with ID living in residential care in the UK using the VOICES-SF questionnaire and compare these with the general population.

Design Nationwide population-based postbereavement survey.

Participants 38 ID care providers took part in the study. The supported over 13 000 people with ID. Over the 18-month period of data collection, 222 deaths were reported. The survey was completed, by care staff, for 157 (70.7%) of those deaths.

Results Decedents had complex health, functional and behavioural needs. Death was unanticipated in a high proportion of cases. Quality of care provided across care settings was generally well rated. However, hospital care and care provided at the time of was less well rated, particularly in comparison with the general population. Respondents reported low levels of involvement in care and awareness of approaching death among adults with ID, and lower than in the general population.

Conclusions Access to end-of-life care for adults with ID may be constrained by a failure to identify approaching the end of life. The high proportion of unexpected deaths in this population warrants further study. There is a need to increase and support the involvement of adults with ID to be active partners in planning care at the end of their lives."

UN Watch announced the launch of a global campaign to expel Venezuela from the council, noting that its 2010 campaign to remove Libya’s Qaddafi regime, created right after the dictatorship was elected, was eventually embraced by EU countries and succeeded within one year. In a detailed study released last week, UN Watch found that four of the newly elected members — Venezuela, Mauritania, Libya, and Sudan — had poor records on respecting human rights at home and in their UN votes, thereby failing to qualify according to the UN’s own membership criteria. The council already counts China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, DR Congo, Eritrea, Qatar, Somalia, Cameroon and Pakistan among its members. The UN General Assembly today also elected Armenia and Brazil, both of whom were deemed “questionable” by UN Watch, due to their problematic human rights records or UN voting records. …"

The Democrats running for president are offering both - and no one's calling them on it. 
 They all promise to curtail carbon-dioxide emissions to ""net zero"" by - depending on the candidate - 2045 (Corey Booker) or 2049 (Andrew Yang) or 2050 (Joe Biden). Bernie Sanders is the most moderate of the bunch; he says he'll reduce carbon-dioxide emissions 71% by 2030. 
 But what would this entail, exactly? And can it even be done? 
 According to a very interesting analysis by professor Roger Pielke of the University of Colorado published recently by Forbes, it would entail putting at least one new nuclear reactor online every week until 2030 or 2050 (the number of new reactors needed to get to ""net zero"" carbon-dioxide emissions depending on how soon we want to get there). Leaving aside the regulatory hurdles involved in permitting a single new plant - and the money that would be have to be found to finance the construction of scores of new plants. 
 Pielke is a mathematician who has done the math, and the numbers are daunting. 
 Assuming we're not going to just turn off the lights - and shut down industrial civilization - it will be necessary to replace the 1,900 million tons of fossil-fueled energy (i.e., coal, oil, natural gas) the U.S. consumes annually with ... something else. 
 Something else that doesn't emit carbon dioxide. 
 Pielke, who is also a climate scientist who worked at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, says the only way to replace that much fossil fuel energy with ""carbon-neutral"" energy using actually feasible technology would be to use nuclear energy. A lot of it. 
 In his Forbes article, Pielke explains that one nuclear power plant like the Turkey Point reactor..."

In addition, six allegations of sexual abuse by seminarians and former seminarians also were sent to Rome, according to this last person. In an interview, an accuser told The Washington Post that many of the boys knew one another. They often would travel together with McCarrick on fundraising trips to churches and the homes of donors around the country, where the abuse allegedly would occur. The accuser and his family met McCarrick at a church function when the man was a small child. As adults, some would speak about their alleged abuse to one another in the barest of terms. It wasn't until late last year, however, after allegations involving two other boys became public, that the man said he and other accusers contacted officials. The Washington Post does not identify victims of sexual assault or abuse without their permission. The man said he and other victims since last year have cooperated with church and civil investigators as well as Vatican officials. After that, he said, he wanted to move on. He was driven, however, to speak out following a recent interview McCarrick gave to Slate in which the onetime fundraising and diplomatic church star denied wrongdoing. In a September article, McCarrick said he is ""not as bad as they paint me. I do not believe that I did the things that they accused me of."" The reporter told him..."

'He had a meeting with Democrats at the White House, he lashed out at Nancy Pelosi' and had what the House speaker described as 'a meltdown — which, is it even really a meltdown anymore? Trump didn't have a meltdown, he had a Wednesday. There's nothing left to melt.' Nevertheless, he added, 'the president doesn't this idea the people know he had a meltdown, so he tweeted a photo from the meeting,' Kimmel said. That didn't go well, either.
The meeting was supposed to be about Syria, Kimmel said, and 'Trump now is stuck,' facing strong bipartisan blowback because 'he basically gave the president of Turkey a green light to kill these people we promised to protect,' the Kurds, but he won't admit he's wrong. 'So today he tried to do damage control,' he said. 'The White House released a letter — this is a letter written by Trump to his strongman buddy President Erdogan — and I'm not sure what this was supposed to prove, other than he's crazy, but this is a real letter from the president of the United States, we did not alter this in any way.'
Kimmel read through the letter, adding some commentary, then noted that Trump sent it on Oct. 9, and 'Erdogan immediately sent his tanks across the border, so it was insane and ineffective, which is the art of the deal.' He imagined JFK writing a similar letter to the Soviet premier during the Cuban missile crisis. Watch below. Peter Weber"

UN Watch announced the launch of a global campaign to expel Venezuela from the council, noting that its 2010 campaign to remove Libya’s Qaddafi regime, created right after the dictatorship was elected, was eventually embraced by EU countries and succeeded within one year. In a detailed study released last week, UN Watch found that four of the newly elected members — Venezuela, Mauritania, Libya, and Sudan — had poor records on respecting human rights at home and in their UN votes, thereby failing to qualify according to the UN’s own membership criteria. The council already counts China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, DR Congo, Eritrea, Qatar, Somalia, Cameroon and Pakistan among its members. The UN General Assembly today also elected Armenia and Brazil, both of whom were deemed “questionable” by UN Watch, due to their problematic human rights records or UN voting records. …"

 European producers of specialty agricultural products like French wine, Italian Parmesan and Spanish olives are facing a U.S. tariff hike due Friday with a mix of trepidation and indignation at being dragged into a trade war they feel they have little to do with. 
 The tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods were approved by the World Trade Organization as compensation for illegal EU subsidies to plane maker Airbus. 
 The U.S. has some leeway in deciding what goods it puts tariffs on. So while it is taxing European aircraft 10 percent more, it is walloping agricultural products an extra 25 percent. 
 ""It's a nightmare,"" says Aurelie Bertin, who runs the 700-year-old winery Chateau Sainte-Roseline in southern France. ""We don't know what will be the result."" 
 Her rose wine business has boomed in recent years thanks to American demand for the beverage. She fears her U.S. sales could drop by a third under the new tariffs. 
 The punitive taxes take particular aim at European agricultural products that have a ""protected name status."" Those are goods that can be sold under a name - like Scotch whisky or Manchego cheese - only if they are from a particular region and follow specific production methods. The result is they fetch premium prices, protect cultural heritage - and are shielded from competitors. 
 U.S.-made Parmesan cheese, for example, is not allowed access to the European market as a copycat of the traditional Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano - a barrier that the U.S. milk producers lobby are pressuring to bring down. 
 Italian President Sergio Mattarella sought to impress on U.S. President Donald Trump during a White House Visit on Wednesday that the taxes may result in a ""mere race between tariffs"" after the WTO decides Europe's case later this year..."
