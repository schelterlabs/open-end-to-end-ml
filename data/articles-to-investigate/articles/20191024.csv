Essex Police said the bodies of 11 victims were moved by a private ambulance from the Port of Tilbury to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford shortly before 8pm on Thursday.

It is thought that the 39 victims, eight of whom were women, were all Chinese nationals.

The bodies were discovered in the refrigerated trailer in Grays, Essex, on Wednesday shortly after 1.30am.

The lorry and trailer were previously moved from the site on the Waterglade Industrial Park in Eastern Avenue under police escort to a secure location at Tilbury Docks to allow for the bodies to be recovered.

Post-mortem examinations will now be carried out as the bodies are recovered as disaster victim identification procedures continue.

Here's one reason it's not likely.,https://s.hdnux.com/photos/21/27/71/4554340/3/rawImage.jpg,"WASHINGTON - With every new revelation in the House impeachment inquiry, some Democrats believe Republicans have finally reached a breaking point and will somehow abandon President Donald Trump. 
 ""This is a sea change,"" Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., told reporters after Tuesday's explosive deposition of William Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine. 
 By Wednesday morning, the seas had indeed changed. Rather than abandoning Trump, several dozen House Republicans who are not members of the committees leading the inquiry marched into a secure briefing room and effectively shuttered the investigation for several hours. 
 What's driving this seemingly parallel-universe behavior? Probably the fact that, in many ways, their voters are living in parallel universes when it comes to what they expect of their politicians when it comes to civility and compromise. 
 A new study published Wednesday by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service demonstrates just how angry voters are at lawmakers on the opposite end of the political spectrum. This ""civility poll"" sought to find out how much voters of all stripes care about the tenor of today's politics and whether they want leaders in Washington to reach compromise. 
 The top-line result is particularly alarming, with a majority of Americans now believing the nation is on ""the edge of a civil war."" But the research provided plenty of explanation for why a Democrat like Lynch expects ""a sea change"" and why a Republican like Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida organized the GOP insurrection. 
 Ask the question one way and it almost looks as if America is a remarkably united nation: 88 percent of voters are ""frustrated by the uncivil and rude behavior"" in Washington, 87 percent believe compromise ""should be the goal for political leaders"" and 84 percent believe behavior that used to..."

 NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and the U.S. ambassador to the organization, Kay Bailey Hutchison, both welcomed the proposal on Wednesday in Brussels when previewing an Oct. 24-25 meeting of the alliance's defense ministers. Hutchison signaled that the German initiative would require European troops on the ground to make it work. 
 Kramp-Karrenbauer's suggestion is ""certainly a positive,"" Bailey Hutchison told reporters. ""If the Turks will ask for more help from the international community, I think the Europeans can step forward."" 
 The response in Brussels was very different to the reaction in Berlin, where the plan was sprung on many of Chancellor Angela Merkel's allies with little warning earlier this week and was greeted with barely veiled contempt by the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats. 
 ""I find it somewhat unusual - and I don't think it should become the way the cabinet works,"" Social Democratic caucus leader Rolf Muetzenich told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday. ""I do think that Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer should learn a little from the discussion that she's confronted in the past few hours."" 
 Kramp-Karrenbauer, known as AKK in Germany, said an internationally agreed security zone would defuse the fighting in northern Syria and allow the focus to return to fighting the Islamic State and allowing displaced Kurds to return. It's not clear how the plan would overlap with Turkey's proposed security zone, designed to be off-limits to U.S.-backed Kurdish forces. Turkey is seeking to clear a swath of territory along its border with Syria currently occupied by Kurds. 
 ""This will certainly be discussed during our meeting,"" Stoltenberg told a..."
