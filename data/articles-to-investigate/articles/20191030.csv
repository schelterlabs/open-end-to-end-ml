 McAleenan submitted his resignation to President Donald Trump on Oct. 11, but Trump has not announced his nominee to take over DHS, the nation's third-largest federal agency, with 240,000 employees. At the conclusion of a House subcommittee hearing Wednesday on global terrorism threats, Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked McAleenan if he was prepared to stay in the job until Trump finds a new secretary. 
 ""I hope a plan for the successor is imminent, but if necessary I will stay on to ensure a smooth transition,"" McAleenan said. 
 Co-workers have scheduled a farewell party for McAleenan on Wednesday afternoon at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, where he spent most of his career. 
 Lawmakers from both parties, as well as current and former DHS officials, say they are bewildered that Trump has moved so slowly to replace McAleenan at the helm of the department responsible for safeguarding the United States from terrorism, cyberattacks, natural disasters and other threats. 
 Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., asked McAleenan about reports this week that the White House could attempt to rewrite the order of succession at DHS to install hard-liner Ken Cuccinelli at the head of the department, devising an elaborate workaround to rules established by the Vacancies Reform Act. 
 Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is a favorite of the president's, but the Justice Department has told the White House that Cuccinelli is not eligible for the job under current rules.
