Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., has described President Donald Trump's public call for a foreign government to investigate former vice president Joe Biden's family as an ""abuse of power."" Ditto former congressman and 2020 presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has characterized Trump's recent conduct - including his July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president - as ""brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections,"" adding that ""continued efforts to hide the truth of the President's abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction."" 
 For congressional Democrats considering impeachment, there is a case to be made that the Constitution's reference to ""high Crimes and Misdemeanors"" applies to Trump's alleged Ukraine plot, charges of a coverup or possible obstruction of justice. And there would be nothing unusual about Congress considering several articles of impeachment: The House voted on four articles against President Bill Clinton - obstruction passed, abuse of power failed - and 11 against President Andrew Johnson. The Senate ultimately voted on two articles against Clinton and three against Johnson. 
 Amid a series of House investigations, however, and several public, potentially incriminating admissions by Trump, Democrats haven't settled on a core legal rationale for impeachment, which is striking, considering the Constitution's answer is staring them in the face. Trump's statements and actions with regard to Ukraine appear to fit one of the few offenses the Constitution specifically lists as impeachable: 
 Bribery. 
 Along with treason, it's the only impeachable offense expressly listed in Article II, Section 4 before the catchall category, ""high Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" as a reason to impeach federal..."

 Trump now finds himself mired in a season of weakness. Foreign leaders feel emboldened to reject his pleas or contradict him. Officials inside his administration are openly defying his wishes by participating in the impeachment probe. Federal courts have ruled against him. Republican lawmakers are criticizing him. He has lost control over major conservative media organs. And polling shows a growing share of Americans disapprove of his job performance and support his impeachment. 
 Many of Trump's Republican allies revolted over his decision to withdraw U.S. troops in Syria, which triggered a bloody Turkish invasion that killed Kurdish fighters and civilians. 
 Trump bragged about sending a ""very powerful letter"" warning Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan not to invade Syria. ""Don't be a fool!"" Trump wrote. But Turkish officials leaked word that their leader had thrown the letter in the trash, and Erdogan then took Trump to task for his ""lack of respect."" 
 ""Are we so weak, and so inept diplomatically, that Turkey forced the hand of the United States of America? Turkey?"" Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee, said in a speech Thursday denouncing Trump's Syria decision as ""a bloodstain in the annals of American history."" 
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wrote an op-ed criticizing the pullout, a rare rebuke of Trump. 
 ""America's wars will be 'endless' only if America refuses to win them,"" he wrote, referencing Trump's frequent argument that his critics want to..."

 Alton homeowner Stacey Noble-Loveland and Godfrey homeowners Angela and Reid MacDowell just recently refashioned their vacant children's bedrooms into more useful spaces as studies and guest bedrooms filled with their own cherished belongings. 
 Noble-Loveland's son, Ty Loveland, 21, left for college three years ago in August. The Bradley University mom made his childhood room into an office/guest bedroom, with Ty's twin bed along one wall. 
 ""For years I was going to fix up a little room, as an office for myself, in the basement,"" Noble-Loveland said. ""I just repainted and fixed up his room as a bedroom/office for me. I'm very close with my son, so I guess that's why it took me three years. It will always be his room, but now I've come to realize that when he's back, he'll be back for visits. The room in the basement never happened, but now I don't need it."" 
 Ty graduates from Bradley University, in Peoria, Illinois, next spring with a degree in game design and will be in hot pursuit of internships over the coming months. 
 ""Jobs can take you anywhere. I've encouraged Ty to have strong roots and wings,"" she said of the Alton High School 2016 graduate. ""I want him to pursue his own interests wherever that takes him, but you only have one hometown and I want him to be proud of his."" 
 Noble-Loveland lived in her Alton, Illinois, home when she was born. Then a house three doors down on Mound Street went on the market, her parents loved it and moved there when she was 3 years old. When the house they moved from went back on the market in 2004,..."

It details the effort by the school to get more black students into college level Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses and the anguish that erupted when a black student and her mother alleged bullying by a white AP English teacher. I can add nothing to Meckler's deep dive into the history of racial diversity and academic excellence at that venerable suburban Cleveland school, which Meckler attended. But I can show how Shaker Heights' campaign to improve AP and IB access compares with the rest of the country. Even though it is hard to motivate teenagers to tackle tough courses, the numbers suggest Shaker Heights has done a good job challenging even average kids. I compile an annual list called the Challenge Index. It ranks high schools that have the greatest participation in college-level exams such as AP and IB. I take the total number of those exams completed by all students at each school and divide it by the number of graduating seniors. On my 2019 list, Shaker Heights has an index ratio of 3.214, in the top 3 percent of U.S. public schools. Some people shrug off that success as a byproduct of the large number of well-educated and affluent families in Shaker Heights, historically both black and white. They don't know that many parents and teachers at well-off schools oppose letting average students into such courses for fear that will put too much stress on those adolescents or diminish the level of instruction. Wiser parents and teachers, such as those at Shaker Heights, understand that AP and IB exams can't be dumbed down because they are written and graded by independent experts, and average students do better in..."
