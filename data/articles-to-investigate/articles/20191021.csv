The governor came into office this year with a large majority in both Houses of the state Legislature and said transportation was among his top priorities. His record so far on the issue is to go back on a campaign promise and then prove wholly unable to move support in favor of his initial plans. 
 So now the  state is waiting  for the next version of his proposal, which is to be named CT 2030 and call for spending about $20 billion over the next decade on highway and Metro-North maintenance and construction. As the wait continues, the administration says talks are underway among top legislators and Lamont staffers. But as far as the public is concerned, no one knows anything. 
 In the meantime, local communities are sounding the alarm. With $30 million in aid to municipalities months overdue, seasonal spending is taking a hit. That means fall tree trimming and, eventually, winter snow removal are at risk. Lamont is delaying action on a bond package,  according to the CT Mirror , to provide leverage to spur lawmakers to help pass the spending plan - a spending plan that, again, no one has seen. 
 Beyond the immediate concern is the realization that transportation is and will continue to be vital to the state's economic competitiveness. There is no prescription for increased job growth in coming years that doesn't rely on better, more reliable roads and rail service. Lamont has said he understands this, and that he is working hard to get as many people as possible on board before the plan is..."
