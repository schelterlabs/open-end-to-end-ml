The action is designed to prevent their escape or release from camps in Syria, where they have been guarded by Kurdish forces now under threat from Turkey's incursion, according to U.S. officials. 
 The move, a rare instance in which the United States has taken direct responsibility for Islamic State prisoners in Iraq and Syria, comes as U.S. officials scramble to ensure that Ankara's unfolding military operation does not permit the Islamic State to regain strength. 
 The roughly 40 individuals being taken into U.S. custody, all considered important Islamic State figures, had been held in a constellation of small prisons in northeastern Syria run by Syrian Kurdish forces who have been the Pentagon's primary partner against the Islamic State in Syria. The Kurds are now pulling guards from those facilities to confront the unfolding Turkish assault. 
 The British pair - part of a group of four British militants dubbed the ""Beatles"" by their hostages - were being detained with the goal of putting them on trial in the United States, said a senior U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. That official said the two men - Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh - had been taken to Iraq; other officials said recent administration discussions about the fate of those prisoners had examined the possibility of bringing them to Iraq. It was not clear whether that had occurred or whether they had been taken somewhere else.

Kaysera was a member of the Crow and Northern Cheyenne tribal communities in Montana. She lived with her grandmother. According to her family, Kaysera was reported missing after she never came home on the night of August 24. On August 29, the body of a young woman was found in the town of Hardin. It wasn’t until two weeks later that local law enforcement confirmed it was Kaysera. The circumstances surrounding her death and disappearance remain a mystery. Her family believes she was murdered, but says local law enforcement is not treating her sudden disappearance and death as foul play. Kaysera is among at least 27 indigenous girls and women reported missing or murdered in Big Horn County in the past decade. Since 2010, there have also been at least 134 cases of missing or murdered indigenous girls and women in the state of Montana. We speak with Grace Bulltail, Kaysera’s aunt and an assistant professor in the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We also speak with the family’s lawyer, Mary Kathryn Nagle, a citizen of Cherokee Nation and a partner at Pipestem Law, P.C., a law firm dedicated to the restoration of tribal sovereignty and jurisdiction."

 Paul Petersen, the assessor for Maricopa County, was arrested Tuesday night on charges of running an adoption fraud scheme, according to an indictment obtained by the Arizona Republic. 
 Petersen, an adoption lawyer licensed in Arizona and Utah, is facing similar charges in Utah, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. 
 The 32-count indictment filed in the Superior Court of Arizona alleges Petersen committed conspiracy, fraud and forgery. Petersen and another person, Lynwood Jennet, are accused of committing fraudulent schemes and artifices for organizing travel for women from the Marshall Islands, a country of volcanic islands between Hawaii and the Philippines, to give up their children for adoption in Arizona. 
 Petersen and Jennet claimed the pregnant women were Arizona residents so they could receive medical services from Arizona's Medicaid system, according to the indictment. 
 Jennet worked for the law office of Paul D. Petersen, according to court documents obtained by News 12 in Arizona. 
 In Utah, where he faces more serious crimes, the attorney general alleges that Petersen transported more than 40 women from the Marshall Islands to have their children in the state between December 2016 and August 2019, offering each women $10,000 through associates, according to Utah court documents. 
 Petersen is charged with communications fraud, human smuggling and sale of a child in Utah. 
 Authorities in Utah started investigating Petersen when concerned hospital workers started cold-calling a human-trafficking tip line, Chief Criminal Deputy Attorney General Spencer Austin said in a statement.

Archbishop Bernardito Auza, the Holy See's Permanent Observer to the UN, on Monday sent an address to the UN General Assembly&rsquo;s third committee that highlighted the &ldquo;unique and irreplaceable&rdquo; role of women in the world.

&ldquo;While significant progress has been made in increasing the participation of women in social, political, economic and cultural life, and in ending violence against women and girls, much remains to be achieved,&rdquo; Auza said.

He cited a report from the UN Secretary-General and said migrant women in particular, including many female migrant workers, are at risk of labor exploitation, human trafficking, and also face broader social exclusion. He said this remains a deep concern of the Holy See.

&ldquo;These women deserve to be welcomed, protected, and integrated within our communities with dignity. They also deserve full and equal recognition before the law, including through access to the justice system,&rdquo; Auza said.

&ldquo;These women courageously leave their land and communities, often in the most difficult circumstances, to provide for their family and to assure their children of a better future. It is necessary, therefore, to adopt specific measures to protect and assist women migrant workers and to recognize their precious contribution to society.&rdquo;

Auza also mentioned the &ldquo;heinous&rdquo; practice of trafficking of newborn babies, as well as forced surrogacy. He called for &ldquo;effective legislation and enforcement to prevent trafficking in persons and limit impunity as much as possible.&rdquo;

&ldquo;While there have been various advances in formulating adequate legal instruments to investigate, prosecute and punish traffickers, in unlocking the financial chains, understanding the connection to other forms of organized crime and corruption, and fostering cooperation at and across borders, concrete measures and effective sanctions remain often limited,&rdquo; he said.

September 2020 marks the 25th anniversary of the UN&rsquo;s Fourth World Conference on Women and the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, parts of which the Vatican spoke out strongly against, including efforts to expand abortion as a means of population control.

Auza quoted Pope St. John Paul II, who wrote in 1995 to the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women.

&ldquo;There will never be justice, including equality, development and peace, for women or for men, unless there is an unfailing determination to respect, protect, love and serve life&mdash; every human life, at every stage and in every situation,&rdquo; Pope John Paul II wrote.

&ldquo;The Holy See insists on equality in dignity between men and women and on equal respect at all stages of their lives...This remains an utmost priority and focus of the Holy See,&rdquo; Auza added.

A federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco cleared the way on Wednesday for a group of PG&E bondholders and wildfire victims to submit a rival financial restructuring plan to compete with the utility's own proposal. 
 
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January, citing billions of dollars of liability for the 2017 and 2018 Northern California wildfires sparked by failures in electrical lines. 
 
On Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali ended the so-called exclusivity period provided by bankruptcy law, during which PG&E was the only entity allowed to propose a financial plan. 
 
The judge wrote that the wildfire victims, whom he called ""the parties most deserving of consideration,"" had ""spoken loudly and clearly"" that they wanted the rival plan to be considered. 
 
The alternative proposal would provide up to $14.5 billion to compensate individual fire victims, while PG&E's plan would furnish $8.4 billion. Both options would also give $11 billion to insurance companies for claims paid and $1 billion to local governments, under agreements previously reached by PG&E.
