 Margaret Cochran of Godfrey turned 100 years old on Wednesday, Oct. 30. To celebrate the event, a reception was held Saturday at her home on Saturday, Oct. 26. She greeted close to 30 family members and friends, who celebrated with cake, punch and plenty of fruit. 
 Cochran was born Oct. 30, 1919, in Fort William, Ontario in an area now known as Thunder Bay. She grew up and attended school there and learned to play the piano. 
 In 1941, she went to Tinsdale College in Toronto where she met Bob Cochran, who was preparing in seminary to become a Baptist minister. They were married there and Bob Cochran served several churches in Ontario before eventually being called to become the pastor of Upper Alton Baptist Church. They served there for close to 10 years. 
 Margaret Cochran obtained a Bachelor of Music degree at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and the couple moved to Wheaton, Illinois, where she taught music in schools and conducted church choirs in several churches 
 The Cochrans then moved back to Godfrey, where they purchased a house and an organ for Margaret Cochran, who loves organ music. She served as organist and choir director at First Baptist Church in Alton and then became organist at Upper Alton Baptist for several years. 
 Bob Cochran died in 1994. 
 Margaret Cochran has one daughter, Elizabeth Blake; one granddaughter; Nancy, and one great-grandson, Justin."

 For weeks, the network has been rebutting allegations by a former correspondent, Ronan Farrow, that it suppressed his reporting on sexual assault allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein and covered up harassment and assault accusations against its former star Matt Lauer. 
 The story has been propelled by Farrow's best-selling book, ""Catch and Kill,"" which asserts - over NBC's strenuous denials and allegations of ""a smear"" - that NBC stopped Farrow's reporting on Weinstein in mid-2017 after Weinstein threatened to reveal Lauer's misconduct. Farrow published a blockbuster story about Weinstein in The New Yorker seven weeks later. 
 On Friday, the call for NBC to come clean on the Weinstein episode came from inside the house. In an extraordinary segment on her MSNBC show, Rachel Maddow urged NBC News to undertake an independent investigation of the network's conduct. 
 ""The allegations about the behavior of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer are gut-wrenching,"" said Maddow, MSNBC's biggest star and the second, after MSNBC host Chris Hayes, to call out her bosses on an NBC-owned platform. ""But accusations that people in positions of authority in this building may have been complicit in some way in shielding those guys from accountability - those accusations are very, very hard to stomach."" Maddow said she had independently confirmed that NBC had halted Farrow's reporting, a key claim in the book. 
 Farrow, who was a guest on Maddow's Friday show, was booked weeks in advance. NBC News's parent company, NBCUniversal, tried to get ahead of Maddow's commentary by issuing a statement releasing former NBC News employees from any ""perceived obligation"" not to speak publicly about sexual harassment at the network during their time of employment. The edict..."
