The implication is that the second official is worried about leaving behind evidence of their conversation. A phone call doesn't leave a paper trail. 
 On Thursday night, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees - Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., respectively - made public a document excerpting text messages exchanged between government officials working on the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. Those officials sat in positions that are currently under intense scrutiny, with still-expanding questions about President Donald Trump's behavior toward Ukraine and his efforts to get that country to conduct investigations that he hoped would aid him politically. 
 While the released text messages are neither comprehensive (representing ""only a subset of the full body of the materials,"" according to the letter accompanying the messages) nor do they directly implicate Trump, they contain significant new revelations and suggestions about the Trump-Ukraine interactions. They include, in two suggestive moments, specifically the sort of don't-document-this responses that imply an awareness of lines being crossed. 
 1. There's an explicitly stated quid pro quo. 
 A central participant in the messages is Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Ukraine. Until last week, he served in the administration, resigning shortly after he was identified in a complaint filed by a whistleblower in the intelligence community. The whistleblower portrayed Volker as working with European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland to try to run interference between Ukrainian officials and Trump's personal..."

At the event, the two sides highly valued their countries’ strategic partnership. The host official noted Spain was the first European nation to have set up a strategic partnership with Vietnam. Over the last 10 years, bilateral economic and trade ties have enjoyed many breakthroughs. Both sides have maintained cooperation in both bilateral and multilateral frameworks like the United Nations and cooperation mechanisms of the European Union. He said his country wishes bilateral cooperation will enjoy more breakthrough developments in the time to come. For his part, NA Vice Chairman Ty said the friendship and collaboration between Vietnam and Spain are currently on an upward trend, especially after the elevation of their ties to the strategic partnership towards the future in December 2009. He affirmed that Vietnam always sees Spain as an important partner in the EU and hopes to promote bilateral connections, particularly in economy, trade and investment. Over the past years, cooperation in economy, trade and investment has been growing unceasingly and become a major pillar in the countries’ relations. However, although the trade revenue of USD3.15 billion in 2018 is an encouraging figure, it has yet to match the two sides’ potential and expectation, according to Ty. During the session, the officials spoke highly of the two governments’ promotion of a meeting of the Inter-governmental Committee this year. They agreed to support the promotion of stronger links between Vietnamese and Spanish businesses, and for organisation of the first meeting of the committee on economic, trade and investment cooperation soon. The two sides also called for stronger ties in the fields that match both countries’ potential and demand like oil and gas exploitation, renewable energy, infrastructure building, tourism, hi-tech agriculture, environmental protection and climate change response. The host official added Spain has strength in tourism, which makes up 15-20 percent of its GDP, noting that he hopes the two countries will step up ties in this regard. On this occasion, the Vice NA Chairman thanked Spain for advocating the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and Investment Protection Agreement (EVIPA), asking it to continue pushing for ratification of these deals. Both sides shared the view that the early enforcement of the EVFTA and EVIPA will generate practical benefits for businesses and people of the two nations. At the meeting, Ty also called on the countries to keep close coordination at multilateral mechanisms, especially within the framework of the UN, the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and the Vietnam-EU cooperation. As a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2020-2021, Chair of ASEAN in 2020 and Chair of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA) for 2019-2020, Vietnam is ready to work with Spain and countries around the world to maintain peace, stability and security and to bolster relations among regions around the world, he noted. He also asked Spain to continue enhancing ties in defence-security and personnel training to help Vietnam promote its defence capacity, thus contributing to regional and global peace and stability. Regarding parliamentary cooperation, both sides agreed to increase mutual visits and the exchange of information and experience, while coordinating with and supporting each other at multilateral parliamentary forums of which Vietnam and Spain are members like the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the Asia-Europe Parliamentary Partnership (ASEP). Vice Chairman Ty wishes the two parliaments will foster ties in supervising the implementation of the two governments’ cooperation deals, and support the countries’ governments, localities, businesses and people to boost mutual understanding and economic links./."

 The high court's intervention could remove a barrier for construction of the $7.5 billion, 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which has been halted for nearly a year because of various permitting woes. 
 Builders of the pipeline, led by primary stakeholder Dominion Energy, and the Trump administration appealed a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that said the U.S. Forest Service lacked authority to grant a permit to tunnel under the popular hiking trail. 
 ""The Supreme Court's acceptance of our petition is a very encouraging sign and provides a clear path forward to resolve this important issue,"" Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said via email Friday morning. 
 Dominion and its coalition, which also includes Duke Energy of North Carolina, argue that more than 50 other pipelines cross beneath sections of the Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Georgia to Maine. 
 Environmental groups who brought the original challenge to the permit vowed to continue fighting.

A video with English translations and excerpts of the transcript are here. With regards to the global system Putin made an interesting historic comparison: in the 19th century they used to refer to a “Concert of Powers.” The time has come to talk in terms of a global “concert” of development models, interests, cultures and traditions where the sound of each instrument is crucial, inextricable and valuable, and for the music to be played harmoniously rather than performed with discordant notes, a cacophony. It is crucial to consider the opinions and interests of all the participants in international life. Let me reiterate: truly mutually respectful, pragmatic and consequently solid relations can only built between independent and sovereign states. Russia is sincerely committed to this approach and pursues a positive agenda."

Like Sergio Leone, who lifted those early Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns out of their genre and made them something special, Rodriguez knows how to handle atmosphere and sudden explosions of violence."
