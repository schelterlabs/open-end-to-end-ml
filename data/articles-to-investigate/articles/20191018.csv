He slept in a bassinet with a monitor that tracked his heart rate and a heat lamp that warmed his limbs. The isolation room was hushed. The doctors wanted it that way because the three-pound patient in the bright blue T-shirt fussed at even the dullest sounds. 
 ""I'm a boy,"" read a note posted in June at the baby's side in the neonatal intensive care unit in Charleston. He was comforted by a nurse who learned long ago to recognize the high-pitched cries of newborns suffering from opioid withdrawal. 
 The two-week-old was among thousands of children separated from their parents and forced into state care by an opioid epidemic that fractured families in every corner of West Virginia, claiming 5,200 lives over two decades. 
 Time and again, state officials vowed to seek justice for the devastation and despair. 
 In 2001, at the dawn of the crisis, West Virginia became the first state to take OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma to court. Officials would go on to file three more high-profile lawsuits against opioid distributors, demanding the companies pay to help offset the fallout of widespread addiction - a reported $8 billion annually in West Virginia alone. 
 Eighteen years later, as a federal judge in Ohio prepares to hear a historic series of opioid lawsuits waged by plaintiffs nationwide, West Virginia's journey provides a case study in how legal battles against drug companies can fail to balance the scales, leaving behind more conflict than resolution in communities still reeling from the crisis. 
 In West Virginia, which has the highest opioid death rate in the country, officials settled the four cases for a total of $94 million. 
 In comparison, Oklahoma settled two opioid-related cases this year, one with..."

 In a winding, 35-minute speech Thursday at Georgetown University's Gaston Hall - where presidents and foreign heads of state have delivered addresses - the Facebook chief executive said the social network had been founded to give people a voice and bring them together and that critics who had assailed the company for doing so were setting a dangerous example. 
 To make his case, Zuckerberg invoked Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War and the First Amendment. He contrasted Facebook's position with that of China, where Beijing controls and censors speech and where he tried unsuccessfully for years to enter to turbocharge his company's business. 
 ""People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world - a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society,"" Zuckerberg, 35, said. 
 He added that despite the messiness of free speech, ""the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us. I'm here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression."" 
 The address by the tech billionaire was an unusually public doubling down on free expression online as debate over that stance has ramped up. It was a sign that Zuckerberg was going on the offense against critics who have accused the Menlo Park company of being an amplifier of disinformation, hate speech and violent content. 
 Zuckerberg made his stand as Facebook has grappled with a firestorm over political speech..."
