              The killers poured kerosene over 18-year-old Nusrat Jahan and set her on fire in April, police say on the orders of the principal. 
              Jahan's family has said that before her death, she had been pressured to rescind her allegations against the principal. 
              The teenager's death sparked public outrage and mass demonstrations calling for her killers to be punished, prompting the prime minister to meet her family and vow to bring the killers to justice. 
              Bangladesh has seen a dramatic rise in the number of rape cases in recent months. 
              According to a report published by a women's right group, 217 women and children were assaulted in September, the highest in any single month since 2010. 
              Many more cases go unreported because women fear being stigmatized. 
              Even when survivors do file a complaint, prosecution is very rare and often takes years to conclude."
