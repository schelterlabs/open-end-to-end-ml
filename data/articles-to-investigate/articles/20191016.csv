The House easily passed a bipartisan resolution Wednesday to condemn Trump's decision to pull troops out of northern Syria ahead of a Turkish military offensive, with the resolution passing 354 to 60, Axios reports. Every Democrat voted in favor, and 129 Republicans also supported the resolution, The Hill reports.
This rebuke to Trump was delivered by the House as he defended his Syria decision Wednesday, saying in the Oval Office, 'If Turkey goes into Syria, that's between Turkey and Syria. It's not between Turkey and the United States.'
But he's continuing to face pushback from Democrats and Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who said Wednesday Trump's Syria pullback is 'the most screwed up decision I have seen since I have been in Congress.' During a press conference later in the day, Trump railed against Graham, who is typically an ally on Capitol Hill, saying, 'Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years, with thousands of soldiers, and fighting other people's wars. I want to get out of the Middle East.' Brendan Morrow"

 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed to rehear the lawsuit, brought by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, which was dismissed over the summer by a three-judge panel of the same court. 
 The brief order set oral arguments before a full panel of judges for Dec. 12, and essentially gives the novel lawsuit, which tests the anti-corruption emoluments provisions of the Constitution, a second chance. 
 In July, a unanimous three-judge panel said Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, both Democrats, lacked legal grounds to bring the case case that says the president violates the Constitution when his business accepts payments from state and foreign governments. 
 That decision, from three judges nominated by Republican presidents, also halted dozens of subpoenas to federal agencies and Trump's private business entities. 
 In a statement after the court's order Tuesday, Frosh said ""every single day, President Trump is receiving payments from foreign governments and from the United States. We intend to hold him accountable for violations of our nation's original anti-corruption laws."" 
 A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
 The lawsuit is one of three major cases testing for the first time the Constitution's ban on the country's leaders engaging in private business relationships with foreign governments. 
 In a New York case, brought by Trump's business competitors, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in September said a lower-court judge had improperly thrown out..."
