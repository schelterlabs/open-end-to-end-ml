When Cook answered, 16-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo shot her in the face, killing her. Shortly after his first murder, Malvo threw up. 
 He had shot the wrong target. On orders from his mentor, John Allen Muhammad, Malvo was supposed to shoot Isa Farrington Nichols, Cook's aunt, who had supported Muhammad's ex-wife in the custody battle over their children. The slaying orphaned Cook's daughter, devastated her family and ended Nichols' marriage. But Nichols, and some other victims of the District of Columbia sniper rampage 17 years ago, are supporting Malvo's bid to be resentenced for his life without parole term, which will be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday as the latest chapter in the high court's evolving reconsideration of how to handle juveniles in the criminal justice system. 
 ""This is not about him being released,"" Nichols said, knowing that even reducing Malvo's 10 life sentences would not lead to his freedom. ""The first time I heard it, I was like, 'Are you kidding me?' This was someone sent to my door to kill me. But as I listened more and more, I understood the totality of what's involved, and the other families involved in youths sentenced to life without parole . . . I believe there's a bigger picture here. This is something that needs to be done."" 
 Not all victims want to see Malvo's case reopened. Nelson Rivera, whose wife Lori Lewis Rivera, 25, was killed by the snipers in Kensington, Maryland, joined an amicus brief filed by the Maryland Crime Victims Resource Center that said the rulings clearing the way for Malvo's resentencing ""re-traumatize, revictimize, and violate the legal and human rights of..."

Kidney transplant recipients must take an active part in their health following the transplantation, since a new organ requires new medication and focus on lifestyle to prevent side-effects and signs of organ rejection. Consequently, it is of major clinical relevance to explore how kidney transplant recipients understand and relate to health literacy. Ten kidney transplant recipients were interviewed at three weeks and again at six months post-transplantation. Design and analysis were inspired by constructivist grounded theory. The results of the study are presented through a model consisting of three phases: the trigger phase, the information phase, and the response phase. The participants were influenced by context and personal factors as they moved between three phases, as information seekers, recipients, and sharers. This study illustrates health literacy as an active process. It gives new insight into what motivates kidney recipients to find, share, and receive information, and how a hierarchy of resources is built and used."
