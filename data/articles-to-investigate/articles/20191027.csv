Giuliani in his search for damaging information about Democrats in Ukraine, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were also attempting to leverage ties they claimed to have to powerful Ukrainian figures and U.S. officials, according to people familiar with their activities. 
 In meetings this summer, the two men said they could broker a multimillion-dollar deal to buy gas from the Middle East on behalf of a Ukrainian billionaire facing bribery charges in the United States. In another, Parnas and Fruman boasted they had enough sway in Trump's administration to secure the attendance of Vice President Mike Pence at the inauguration of the new Ukrainian president - for a price. 
 Since they were arrested earlier this month on campaign finance charges, investigators have been working to untangle their dizzying web of business enterprises - and to discern whether they were operating on their own or backed by more influential interests. 
 Their claims of high-level connections have deepened questions about the motives of the two men, whose efforts to help Giuliani locate information in Ukraine have thrust them into the glare of the ongoing impeachment inquiry. 
 While they were helping Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman were also allegedly working with a Russian businessman who wanted to invest in marijuana dispensaries in the United States, channeling his money into illegal campaign donations, according to their indictment. 
 And during the summer, in a pitch that has not been previously reported, Parnas, Fruman and their associate David Correia proposed to serve as middlemen in a deal to sell natural gas from the Middle East to fertilizer companies owned by a Ukrainian billionaire, Dmytro Firtash, according to people familiar with their activities who, like others, spoke on the..."

As power shutdowns went into effect around the Bay Area Saturday night, PG&E officials said that another wind-related weather event is expected to hit the area midweek, and could trigger another round of Public Safety Power Shutoffs, a PG&E official said. 
 
Andy Vesey, PG&E's president and CEO, said Saturday that once power returns to Northern California in a few days, preparations for another cycle should begin. 
 
""As your power comes back on, please use that time to prepare again,"" Vesey said at a news conference. 
 
On Saturday, PG&E started the latest round of shutoffs, some of which are expected to last into early next week. 
 
Mark Quinlan, PG&E's director of wildfire operations, said that in the North Bay, outages were to have started at about 5 p.m., affecting some 260,000 customers. The estimated ""all clear"" time at which a restart could begin was listed as about 4 p.m. Sunday. 
 
In the South Bay and East Bay, Quinlan said, outages were supposed to begin about 8 p.m., affecting 246,000 customers. The ""all clear"" time for restoring power in those areas, Quinlan said, is about 8 a.m. Monday. 
 
The ""all clear"" time, PG&E has stressed, isn't when the lights come back on, but when that process can begin. The process, which involves inspecting the lines and other facilities for damage, can take several hours. 
 
Overall, power shutoffs in the Bay Area, portions of the Sierra and along the North Coast are expected to affect 940,000 customers, translating to more than 2.5 million people, Vesey said.

Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs, appeared before lawmakers under a subpoena Saturday in a closed-door deposition related to Congress' investigation of the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine. Reeker told House members he planned to release a statement in support of Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, after she was forced out of the role by the Trump administration because she didn't agree with the White House's foreign policy practices in Ukraine, a person familiar with the testimony said. Ultimately, Reeker reportedly testified, he was blocked from doing so by David Hale, the under secretary of state for political affair and the No. 3 official in the State Department.
Reeker also reportedly said he was aware of a plan to freeze military aid to Ukraine, but he was not aware of why it was being held and had no knowledge of any alleged quid-pro-quo scheme. One anonymous source told Politico that Reeker was able to provide a good amount of information about the Yovanovitch situation, but 'he doesn't really have much knowledge or involvement in the rest of the story.'
