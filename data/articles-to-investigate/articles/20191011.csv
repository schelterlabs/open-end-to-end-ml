He gives it to them.,https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/img/pages/article/opengraph_default.jpg,"President Donald Trump has been fiercely criticized for requesting that Ukraine investigate his leading political rival, former vice president Joe Biden. But Trump doesn't just ask foreign leaders for domestic electoral assistance: He also gives it to them. Trump has now done just that for Turkish President Erdogan, offering a foreign policy favor for domestic political benefit. He has, in effect, done for Erdogan exactly what he asked of Ukrainian President Zelensky. And either seeking or providing such electoral interference is wildly inappropriate for a U.S. president. 
 Like Trump, who is unpopular at home, Turkey's Erdogan has a problem - indeed, the same problem as Trump. His party lost big in local elections earlier this year, in part because he, like Trump, has been ineffective at governing, and especially at managing Turkey's now-flailing economy. So he, too, needs to improve his domestic political standing; and like Trump, who looked to Ukraine for assistance, Erdogan sought help from another country. 
 In this case, that meant looking for a way to attack a familiar target for the Turkish government, the Kurds. Aggressive threats against the Kurds have become a staple for Turkish politicians, who decry the ethnic group as terrorists. More specifically, for Erdogan attacking the Kurds right now means creating space in Syria to send back displaced Syrians who've flooded into Turkey. Hence, the Wall Street Journal describes Erdogan as ""facing growing discontent at home, including from his electoral base, with a majority of Turks calling for the government to send displaced Syrians back home."" Erdogan thus asked Trump for help: to get out of the way and give him the green light to attack the Kurds, thus making space in northern Syria to which to send back displaced Syrians. 
 But where Trump didn't get what he asked..."

He gives it to them.,https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/img/pages/article/opengraph_default.jpg,"President Donald Trump has been fiercely criticized for requesting that Ukraine investigate his leading political rival, former vice president Joe Biden. But Trump doesn't just ask foreign leaders for domestic electoral assistance: He also gives it to them. Trump has now done just that for Turkish President Erdogan, offering a foreign policy favor for domestic political benefit. He has, in effect, done for Erdogan exactly what he asked of Ukrainian President Zelensky. And either seeking or providing such electoral interference is wildly inappropriate for a U.S. president. 
 Like Trump, who is unpopular at home, Turkey's Erdogan has a problem - indeed, the same problem as Trump. His party lost big in local elections earlier this year, in part because he, like Trump, has been ineffective at governing, and especially at managing Turkey's now-flailing economy. So he, too, needs to improve his domestic political standing; and like Trump, who looked to Ukraine for assistance, Erdogan sought help from another country. 
 In this case, that meant looking for a way to attack a familiar target for the Turkish government, the Kurds. Aggressive threats against the Kurds have become a staple for Turkish politicians, who decry the ethnic group as terrorists. More specifically, for Erdogan attacking the Kurds right now means creating space in Syria to send back displaced Syrians who've flooded into Turkey. Hence, the Wall Street Journal describes Erdogan as ""facing growing discontent at home, including from his electoral base, with a majority of Turks calling for the government to send displaced Syrians back home."" Erdogan thus asked Trump for help: to get out of the way and give him the green light to attack the Kurds, thus making space in northern Syria to which to send back displaced Syrians. 
 But where Trump didn't get what he asked..."

Addressing the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of French Defence Industries in Paris, Rajnath Singh called upon the French companies for collaboration to modernise India's shipyards and defence platforms by infusion of technology and asked them to make India its base for production of defence equipment not only for India's large market but also for export to other countries, read a statement.

""We have undertaken significant economic reforms to improve the ease of doing business and opening up the economy for investments. Our Government under the leadership of our Prime Minister Modi has opened up defence sector manufacturing to a large extent under the 'Make in India' initiative,"" Rajnath Singh said.

The Defence Minister underlined the significance of implementation of a single Goods and Services Tax (GST) across India.

""We have recently reduced our corporate tax significantly. For 'Make in India' in Defence if there is need for further tax rationalisation, it may be considered suitably,"" Rajnath Singh said.

Rajnath Singh applauded the French companies for regularly participating in DefExpos organised in India with great energy and enthusiasm.

He also extended a special invitation to the French firms to participate in DefExpo, which will be held in Lucknow from February 5-8 next year.

""Lucknow happens to be a city of rich culture and heritage and the French people are known to be highly appreciative of great cultures. Lucknow is the capital of Uttar Pradesh which is also a land of new opportunities,"" Rajnath Singh said.

Moreover, the Defence Minister highlighted India's substantial requirement of Aero engines both in civil and military domains. He requested French OEMs to consider exploring development of an Aero-engine complex on government -to- government basis saying French companies could leverage from advantages in India such as low wages and availability of technical manpower, the statement added.

India's Ambassador to France, Vinay Kwatra gave the welcome address. Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Barun Mitra also gave a presentation on DefExpo 2020. Ajay Kumar, Defence Secretary also addressed the CEOs."

New England Senator Maggie Hasan said this in a tweet on Thursday night.

Hasan, who is currently on a visit to the region, is now headed to India after travelling to Afghanistan and Pakistan.

In Pakistan, she met Prime Minister Imran Khan and Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa to discuss joint counter-terrorism work and regional stability.

""We also visited Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. Amid escalating tensions in Kashmir, it's critical that we find ways to help de-escalate the situation on both sides,"" she tweeted.

""I'm now travelling to India where I'll meet officials to further discuss the situation and international trade,"" she added.

Ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5. Pakistan reacted angrily to the move and expelled the Indian envoy. Since then, Pakistan has been trying to rally international support against India on the issue.

India has been maintaining that the Kashmir issue is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan and there is no scope for any third-party mediation."
