 ""I'm sorry Mom. My journey abroad hasn't succeeded,"" read a harrowing text sent by Pham Thi Trà My, 26, on Tuesday night. ""Mom, I love you so much! I'm dying because I can't breathe."" 
 The text, released to media outlets by Trà My's family, was received at 10:28 p.m. London time, which would coincide with when the container is thought to have been crossing the North Sea from Belgium on its way to Britain. 
 The truck was found early Wednesday morning by local ambulance services at an industrial estate in Essex, about 25 miles east of central London. The gruesome discovery has turned into one of Britain's largest homicide cases. 
 Four people, including the driver of the truck, have been detained. 
 A spokesman for the Vietnamese embassy in London confirmed to The Washington Post that Trà My's family had contacted the embassy over fears that she was among the dead. 
 In a separate statement, the embassy said three Vietnamese families had contacted its consular protection hotline for help verifying whether their relatives were among the victims. Embassy officials were communicating with British police and had requested a visit to Essex, where the truck was found. 
 Police had said Thursday that the victims were believed to be Chinese nationals, but in an update on Friday, they cautioned that ""the picture may change regarding identification"" as the investigation continues. 
 As that investigation progressed on Friday, police arrested a man and a woman, both 38, from Warrington, England, ""on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter.""

Detectives connected the suspect, 19-year-old Amirah Dennard, to  11 cases of grab and run thefts since April, Sgt. Justin Graham said.   Dennard allegedly returned to the mall in August and stole  merchandise worth more than $6,500 from three stores. Detectives learned her  identity from vehicle descriptions, license plates and surveillance video,  but they had no known address for her, Graham said.    Dennard returned to the Northgate Mall on Oct. 16 and 18 and  committed three additional thefts, according to Graham. She allegedly  threatened to pepper-spray a store clerk as she left the store with clothing.   When Dennard returned to the mall on Wednesday morning, she  allegedly parked in a red zone and detectives followed her into a Kohl's  store, Graham said. Detectives approached her while she gathered clothing,  and Dennard dropped the clothing and ran, according to Graham.   A store employee tried to tackle Dennard but she allegedly  pepper-sprayed the employee and a pursuing detective. Graham said additional  officers converged on Dennard and she was taken into custody.    Detectives apparently found large quantities of clothing in her  vehicle and they are trying to determine who it belonged to, according to  Graham.   Dennard was booked on suspicion of multiple offenses including  burglary, robbery, possession of stolen property, illegal use of pepper  spray, obstructing a peace officer and driving on a suspended license.

Jason Perillo and Ben McGorty and state Sen. Kevin Kelly met with business owners and professionals on Tuesday, Oct. 23, to discuss the impact of legislation that was passed during the 2019 session will have on their industries. 
 During the 2019 session, Shelton's legislators said the majority party Democrats passed major anti-business bills, which included increasing the minimum wage to $15, implementing a payroll tax to fund paid family leave, raising the business filing fees and reducing the tax credit for pass-through entities. 
 The lawmakers explained that they wanted to host the forum to make businesses aware of what was passed and how to prepare for the new laws. They also urged businesses to be vocal about how policies discussed in Hartford will impact them and make their voices heard during the legislative session. 
 ""Democratic lawmakers and Gov. Ned Lamont say they care about business owners, but this couldn't be further from the truth,"" said Perillo. ""These anti-business bills will cost businesses more money and could cause more to close their doors. Instead of asking businesses for more, we should be asking what we can do to make it easier for them to do business in our state."" 
 ""We are one of the worst states in the nation to do business in, and this session the Democrats decided to pass more bills that will not get us out of the dead last rankings,"" added McGorty. ""I want to let businesses know Rep. Perillo, Sen. Kelly and I have their backs and will continue to fight for them in Hartford, but we also need their help in speaking out against these bills when they come before the legislature.""
